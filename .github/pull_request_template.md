### 1. Classification & Tagging

- [ ] **Frontmatter Complete:** Does the file have a `title`, `id`, and `tags`?
- [ ] **Archetype Association:** Is the primary entity correctly tagged?
- [ ] **File Location:** Is the file in the correct sub-directory (e.g., `/docs/archetypes`, `/docs/rituals`)?

### 2. Connection & Integration

- [ ] **Internal Links:** Does this new lore link to at least one existing file?
- [ ] **Backlinks Check:** Have you considered which existing files should now link back to _this_ one?
- [ ] **Orphan Status:** Is this a new "Orphan" or is it being integrated from an existing one?

### 3. Stability & Tone

- [ ] **Canon Conflict:** Have you performed a final check for any contradictions with core lore?
- [ ] **Void Tongue:** Does the language and tone align with the "Modern Void Tongue" style?
