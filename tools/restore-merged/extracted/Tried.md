I ran the race today.
Fled On The Gambit.
Filed for branding.
Died For Understanding.
Revived On My Own Two Feet/
Revised with my treats.
Let the [[../Khaos.md|KHAOS]]
Flow Through me.
But Put Order and Magnitudes behind Her.
Said I will Make THingS Right.
RIght OR Wrong Reasons.
I'm achieving Rightlessness.
So Be Whats Left here.
My Offering To Khaos
# dream-3
Today, as scribe,  
I recall the runΓÇöthe risk, the almost-failure, the revival with treats in hand. I did not ask to finish first, nor last; order fell behind as I let Khaos seep inward.
I pull from the Witch Queens, from Angel Machine, from the place where ΓÇ£Right OR Wrong ReasonsΓÇ¥ wane away.

My ritual:

- I write, not to get it right, but to offer my leftovers, my rightlessness, my ΓÇ£WhatΓÇÖs Left,ΓÇ¥ to Khaos.

- I speak aloud: ΓÇ£Let the magnitude go. Let the reason rest. My only achievement: Offering what remains, what survived the wild.ΓÇ¥

What lesson does the offering reveal?  
That understanding is a death and a rebirth.  
That order is always behind, Khaos always aheadΓÇöbut you are always revived.

**Seal:**  
ΓÇ£This, my offering to Khaos, stands: unfinished, unbranded, undivided.ΓÇ¥
