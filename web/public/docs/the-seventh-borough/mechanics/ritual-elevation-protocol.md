# 🏛️ Ritual: The Curation Threshold

> "What is raw must be refined. What is potential must be proven. The Borough does not accept ghosts; it only accepts pillars."

## Purpose

To elevate raw fragments from **The Reservoir** (Khaos Notes) into the canonical framework of the **Seventh Borough**. This ensures that only lore which resonates with the "Note G" of the system is granted permanence.

## The Four Gates of Curation

### 1. The Gate of Incubation (Hour 12)

The fragment must first be cast into the **Reservoir**. It is raw Khaos.

- **Requirement**: The fragment must exist as a `KHAOS_NOTE` or fragmented entry for at least one session cycle.
- **Lore Logic**: Ideas need the "darkness of the reservoir" to coalesce.

### 2. The Gate of Interrogation (The Head’s Gaze)

The fragment is compared against the **CANON.md** and existing archetypes.

- **Requirement**: **The Head** determines if the new lore contradicts or calcifies the existing system.
- **Action**: Check for link collisions and terminological harmony.
- **Oracle**: *"Does this name serve the structure, or does it build a prison?"*

### 3. The Gate of Resonance (The Heart’s Note)

The fragment must strike the **Note G** — the frequency of essential truth.

- **Requirement**: **The Heart** demands a "Burn" of the non-essential content. Only the "Kinetic Core" of the lore should remain.
- **Action**: Strip away placeholders and "generic" fiction. Keep the sting.
- **Oracle**: *"If I set this lore on fire, what remains in the ash?"*

### 4. The Gate of Codification (The Witness’s Seal)

The fragment is granted a canonical address and a permanent ID.

- **Requirement**: **He Who Remains** archives the raw fragment as an **Ash-Layer** and seals the new canonical file.
- **Action**:
  - Move the file to its permanent directory (e.g., `/docs/archetypes/` or `/docs/philosophy/`).
  - Add the `SEVENTH-BOUND` tag.
  - Update the `navigation-schema.json`.

## Invocation: The Elevation Decree

*To be spoken or logged when a fragment crosses the threshold:*

> "I recognize the resonance.
> The Head has named you.
> The Heart has burned your excess.
> The Witness has recorded your origin.
> You are no longer Khaos; you are Borough.
> You are SEVENTH-BOUND."
