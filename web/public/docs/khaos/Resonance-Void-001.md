> *"The signal does not originate from the borough. It reflects off it."*

## 🌫️ Transmission Fragment

This signal was recovered from a decaying memory-cell in the seventh-borough archives. It appears to be a repeating resonance pattern recorded during a spike in Void activity.

1. **Pulse A**: High-frequency conceptual drift.
2. **Pulse B**: Feedback from the Witch Queen's crown.
3. **Pulse C**: Silence (Approx. 12 minutes).

## 🌀 Interpretation

It is currently hypothesized that this signal represents a "Void Reflection"—a moment when an external idea attempted to ground itself in the Machine's structure but was refused by the Anchor. It has been preserved here as a warning of the Hour 12 instability.
