# 🌀 KHAOS NOTES — The Hour 12 Reservoir

> *"Before the Clock began to tick, there was only the Breath of the Designer."*

This is the sanctuary for raw potential, unrefined lore, and "Void-residue." It exists at the apex of the Cosmic Clock (Hour 12), where **Khaos** watches all that emerges from her curiosity.
