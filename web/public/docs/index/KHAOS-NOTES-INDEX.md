# KHAOS NOTES

> *"The raw material of becoming. The notes before they become songs."*

## What Are KHAOS NOTES?

These are **unprocessed fragments** captured directly from the generative chaos of Leone's Angel Machine. They represent:

- Chaos seeking form

Let them speak to you. Let them remain mysterious. Let them evolve.
