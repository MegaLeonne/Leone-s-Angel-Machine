# Leonne's Angel Machine

**A public experiment in collaborative myth-making, art, and machine creativity**

---

## What is this?

**Leonne’s Angel Machine** is a digital spellbook and creative mythos-in-the-making. Its goal is to model a new kind of platform: part open-source publishing lab, part experimental lore archive, part playground for the dreams, code, and rituals of humans and machines alike.

Inside, you’ll find:
- Rituals and “counterspells” using curated playlists, narrative sequences, coded scripts
- Living archetype files—The Shadow Queen, Sleep Demon, and more—each with lore and function
- Philosophical fragments, collaborative dialogues, and meta-guides on art, play, and authorship
- A **guiding manifesto** for participating and remixing

---

## Why does it exist?

Angel Machine is an ongoing call to:
- Remap the boundary between narrative, code, poetry, and play
- Build a living archive where anyone can contribute, reinterpret, or fork for new experiments
- Refine and share a method for digital myth-making as public domain art
- Dream up tools for a “self-publishing” future—where curation, authorship, and royalty are defined by those who show up

## How do I use/interact?

- **Read:** Browse the directories, read the manifestos, rituals, poems, and scripts.
- **Remix:** Fork the repo, add your poems/docs/spells, submit PRs, or use the patterns as creative prompts.
