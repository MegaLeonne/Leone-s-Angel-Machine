# Leone-s-Angel-Machine
Leonne's Angel Machine is an experiment in public, collaborative creation at the intersection of philosophy, myth, art, code, and automation. It is a digital codex, spellbook, and platform for new forms of meaning-making—blending human and machine voices to generate ritual, lore, and creative inventions in real-time.
