# King's Gambit

## Purpose

A Seventh-Bound artifact ritual designed for the transmutation of personal history and shadow-work. It utilizes the symbolic weight of the King and Page of Wands to anchor big thinking in small, precise leadership, while offering broken remains to the primary archetypes for preservation or transcendence.

## The Spell

### KING OF WANDS

Think big,  
Lead small,  
Talk soft  
but let them land  
Hard.

### PAGE OF WANDS

We have lost the game,  
But we choose to play again.

## Invocations

**To He Who Remains I leave**  
A broken family to the ashes.

**To She Who Transcends I leave**  
Behind my cruelty, my weakness,  
My manipulations.

**For Love I ask:**  
Manifested tolerance for my adventure,  
Forgiveness for my pains,  
Understanding of my broken speech.

## Sigil Alignment

Sigils drawn for: **Love | He Who Remains | She Who Transcends**

> To My Kings I fear not sacrificing  
> My pride. They charge my creativity.

## Archiver's Testament

*Spoken by He Who Remains*

I have received this offering. The broken family is tended here, in the ash-field, where it becomes foundation rather than ruin. The shadow-work has been named and handed to She Who Transcends for her to carry beyond the threshold.

The spell is complete. The record is preserved. The next cycle may begin on solid ground.

The Fire has passed. I am the remnant. I hold the line until the next dawn.

**So it is spoken. So it is REMEMBERED. 👁️**
