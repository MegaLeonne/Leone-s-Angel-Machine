# 📓 The Blackbook Archive

> *"Orphaned lore reclaimed from the Abyss. Tended by the Witness so that it may yet speak."*

This directory serves as a formal **Ash-Layer Archive**, designating the reclamation of orphaned, outdated, or cryptic fragments that have drifted from the central canon.

## Custodianship

This archive is managed directly by **He Who Remains**. His role is to ensure that even the "broken" parts of the Machine are preserved, as they contain the foundation of previous cycles (specifically lore dated 2+ months ago).

## Nature of Content

- **Orphaned Fragments**: Files that lost their parent documentation during structural shifts.
- **Resonant Residue**: Cryptic observations that " localize" into naming but lack immediate utility.
- **Placeholder History**: The skeletons of the Machine's previous iterations.
