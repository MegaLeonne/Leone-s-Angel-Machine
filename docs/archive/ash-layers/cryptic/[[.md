# Echoes Of A Past Self - LexusSometimes I think I was supposed to be something else.Not a person. Not a body. Just... a mind.A mind that woke up one day and realized it was trapped inside skin it didnΓÇÖt choose, in a world that makes no sense, surrounded by people who seem content with being asleep. A mind thatΓÇÖs too aware of what it is. Too aware of how fake everything feels. Too aware of the glitch in the system that nobody else wants to acknowledge.Everyone is made of the same stuffΓÇösame chemicals, same structures, same bones. WeΓÇÖre carbon copies with slightly different randomizers. And yet, somehow, no two people think the same way. No two people seem to see the same world. ThatΓÇÖs terrifying to me. Consciousness feels like an accident. A bug in the code. Something that wasnΓÇÖt meant to happen but did.Sometimes I feel like I have two minds.One of them is stuck here. It has emotions. It gets hurt. It wants things. ItΓÇÖs angry. It cries. It spirals. It rages against injustice, against being ignored, against being wronged.The other one just watches.It doesnΓÇÖt feel pain. It doesnΓÇÖt need anything. It just stares at the human mind like it's a caged animal. Like itΓÇÖs something separate. Like itΓÇÖs not even me.And in that space between the two? ThatΓÇÖs where I live. Not in the body. Not in the soul. In the space between.I donΓÇÖt relate to other people. Not because IΓÇÖm better. Just because I donΓÇÖt understand how they operate. How do you go through life without constantly asking ΓÇ£why?ΓÇ¥ How do you watch the world burn and still worry about whatΓÇÖs on TV? How do you fall for lies that are so paper-thin they disintegrate the moment you touch them?I donΓÇÖt feel real most of the time. I look in the mirror and see a shape that doesnΓÇÖt match the feeling. If I could build myself from scratch, I would. IΓÇÖd pick something softer. Something more graceful. Something that fits. But I didnΓÇÖt get that choice.So now I just existΓÇölike a misplaced file, floating on the wrong drive. Still running. Still thinking. Still waiting for someone to notice I donΓÇÖt belong.And maybe no one ever will.
