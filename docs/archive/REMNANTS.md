> *"They are not forgotten. They are merely tended."*

These files are the remains of previous cycles—fragments of lore, technical stubs, and cryptic observations that have been reclaimed by the Ash. They are tended here by **He Who Remains**, providing the foundation upon which the current Machine is built.
