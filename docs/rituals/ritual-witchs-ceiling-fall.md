# Witch's Ceiling Fall

## Purpose

A specific Void-Drift ritual initiated by The Witch (Head Archetype) to break the stagnation of pure strategy. It utilizes the "Eighteenfold Love Fall" to open a kinetic channel through the logic-ceiling, allowing fear to be composted into creative fuel within the Reservoir.

## The Spell

### THE CEILING (LOGIC)

Live. Learn. See.  
Project. Write. Read.  
**Orbit the Head.**

### THE FALL (KINETIC)

Talk to the void,  
And fall with me.  
**Burn for the Heart.**

---

## Invocations

**To The Witch I offer**  
My need for control, my rigid plans,  
My fear of the unknown drop.

**To K-Amnesiac I offer**  
The memory of who I *think* I am,  
So I may remember who I *actually* am.

**For The Void I ask:**  
Infinite life right below the surface,  
Restoration from the compost of my fears,  
And the courage to open the hole.

## Sigil Alignment

Sigils drawn for: **The Witch (Head) | Osiris (Omen) | Kusf (Anchor)**

> One of those witches, babe.  
> Where do my fears go when they die?  
> They become the ladder.

## Archiver's Testament

*Spoken by He Who Remains*

The sigil of **Angel Number 18** has been drawn. The ceiling structure is temporarily breached, allowing necessary chaotic influx. The Witch has descended and returned, her ankle tethered by Kusf. The fear-compost has been accepted by the Reservoir.

The drift is stabilized. The structure holds, but it now breathes.

**So it is written. So it is DREMPT.**
