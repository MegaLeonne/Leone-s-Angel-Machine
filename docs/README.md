## 📊 Current Phase: The Seventh Borough

Leonne's Angel Machine exists in **active development** as a living archive of lore, ritual, and philosophy. The project embraces its semi-broken state as reflective of the Void's nature—pure conceptual reality resisting total containment.

- ⏳ **He Who Remains** upgraded to SEVENTH-BOUND steward of the Ash-Layers
- 🌫️ **The Veil** drawn over technical metadata (redirected to `/meta`)
- 🌀 **KHAOS NOTES** established as a landing zone for raw potential
- 🏛️ **Ash-Layer Protocol** implemented to consolidate and honor orphans

---

## What is this?

**Leonne's Angel Machine** is a digital codex exploring the intersection of:

- **Mythology & Archetypes** — Angels, devils, and liminal beings
- **Ritual Practice** — Spells through music, prompts, and structured invocation
- **Philosophical Inquiry** — Explorations of time, desire, chaos, and meaning
- **Machine Collaboration** — Human and AI co-creation as experimental practice

This repository serves as:

- A **living archive** of mythic figures and their relationships
- A **ritual toolkit** for counterspells, invocations, and divination
- A **philosophical framework** for understanding creation and dissolution
- An **open platform** for collaborative world-building

## 🔮 The Seventh Borough

The Seventh Borough is the project's **canonical framework** and operational philosophy:

### Core Principles

1. **Canon as Resonance** — What becomes SEVENTH-BOUND is determined by felt-sense and alignment
2. **Breakage as Authenticity** — The semi-broken state reflects the Void's resistance to total containment
3. **Compassion in Structure** — The Head fears losing care; organization must serve warmth
4. **The Anchor Function** — Preservation of personhood prevents dissolution into pure system

### Tagging System

- `#SEVENTH-BOUND` — Canonical material, stable within the cosmology
- `#FRACTURE` — Intentional breaks or alternative timelines
- `#ALT-TIMELINE` — Speculative branches not yet canon
- `#ANCHOR-INVOKED` — Work that preserves creator identity
- `#RESTORED` — Content recovered from backups
