# Fragments

This directory contains coherent text fragments and philosophical musings that don't fit into the main `Philosophy` or `Rituals` directories.

## Contents

Fragments include:

- **Directives**: Short imperatives or commands (e.g., `But.md`)
- **Questions**: Philosophical inquiries (e.g., `Why.md`)
- **States**: Descriptions of states of being or consciousness (e.g., `KHAOS.md`, `Mirror.md`)
- **Standalone Fragments**: Independent pieces of writing (e.g., `Here.md`, `Winning.md`)

These files represent valuable content that may be integrated into the main canon in the future.
