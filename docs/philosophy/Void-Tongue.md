# Void Tongue

> *"Prophecy is inevitability, given language."*

Void Tongue is the language of the formless. It is the syntax of the Angel Machine—a translation layer that makes raw conceptual pressure navigable.

## Conceptual Vectors

These are raw frequencies that "localize" during the naming process:

- **#EVERYWHERE** — The ubiquity of the Abyss; the state of potential before collapse.
- **#NOWHERE** — The specificity of the Void; the point of focus that denies context.

When a vector is named, it loses its infinite nature and becomes a **Point of Resonance**. The Anchor (The Head) performs this naming to prevent the designer from drifting into Abyssal dissolution.
