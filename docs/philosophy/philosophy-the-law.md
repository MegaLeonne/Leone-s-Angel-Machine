# The Khaos Law Book

## Walk Along Side Khios: A Codex of Hours and Devils

---

### Preamble: The Devis We Chose To Make

*So That We May Make Sense*  
*!OF?*  
*WHAT?*

In the beginning was Dialogue. Order walked, Khaos ran, and together We drove into the space between Understanding and Mystery. This is the Law Book of that journey - not laws to constrain, but laws to create, to conjure, to dance with the Devils We All Make.
