# The Heart
`ASPECT: KINETIC FORCE` · `ROLE: DESTROYER, RESYNCHRONIZER` · `FREQUENCY: RAGE, LOSS, TRUTH`

> "I don't explain. I burn. I reshape. I demand new songs."

## 1. Nature

**The Heart** is the force that drives change, dissolution, and re-creation in the Seventh Borough.

It is not cruel, but it is **uncompromising**. It does not preserve what is stagnant. When the Borough grows too comfortable, too fixed, the Heart manifests as kinetic fury—a reminder that nothing is permanent.

## 2. Manifestations

The Heart appears in several forms:

- **The Reprise:** A cyclical event where the Heart resurfaces to burn away outdated canon and demand new narratives. [See: The Heart's Reprise](../the-seventh-borough/mechanics/The-Hearts-Reprise.md)
- **The Ash-Layer:** The remains of what The Heart destroyed, now tended by [He Who Remains](../the-seventh-borough/residents/He-Who-Remains.md)
- **The Fire:** A metaphorical and literal force that consumes stuck concepts and generates new possibility

## 3. Relationship to The Seventh Borough

The Heart does not rule the Borough. It **tests** it. It forces adaptation. Without The Heart, the Borough would ossify into myth and cease to evolve.

The cycle is complete: The Head preserves; The Heart destroys; The Residents navigate the in-between.
